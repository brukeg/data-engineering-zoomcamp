## Setup

```sql
-- Create an external table for Jan-June 2024 yellow Taxi data using parquet.
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `PROJECT-ID.DATASET-ID.external_yellow_tripdata`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'PARQUET',
  uris = ['gs://BUCKET-NAME/FOLDER-NAME/yellow_tripdata_2024-*.parquet']
);
```

```sql
-- Load data into a materialized BigQuery table for Jan-June 2024 yellow Taxi data using parquet.
LOAD DATA INTO brukeg_hw3.m_yellow_tripdata_2024
FROM FILES (
  format = 'PARQUET',
  uris = ['gs://brukeg-yellow-taxi-2024-hw/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2024-*.parquet']
);
```

1. What is count of records for the 2024 Yellow Taxi Data?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(1)
FROM PROJECT-ID.DATASET-ID.external_yellow_tripdata;
```

| count    |
|----------|
| 20332093 |

**20,332,093**


2. Write a query to count the distinct number of PULocationIDs for the entire dataset on both the tables. What is the estimated amount of data that will be read when this query is executed on the External Table and the Table?

```sql
-- count the distinct number of PULocationIDs on external table
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(PULocationID))
FROM `compact-arc-447521-f9.brukeg_hw3.external_yellow_tripdata`;
```

```sql
-- count the distinct number of PULocationIDs on external table
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(PULocationID))
FROM `brukeg_hw3.m_yellow_tripdata_2024`;
```

**0 MB for the External Table and 155.12 MB for the Materialized Table**


3. Write a query to retrieve the PULocationID from the table (not the external table) in BigQuery. Now write a query to retrieve the PULocationID and DOLocationID on the same table. Why are the estimated number of Bytes different?

```sql
-- retrieve the PULocationID
SELECT PULocationID
FROM `brukeg_hw3.m_yellow_tripdata_2024`;
```
155.12


```sql
-- retrieve the PULocationID and DOLocationID
SELECT PULocationID, DOLocationID
FROM `brukeg_hw3.m_yellow_tripdata_2024`;
```
310.24 bytes

**BigQuery is a columnar database, and it only scans the specific columns requested in the query. Querying two columns (PULocationID, DOLocationID) requires reading more data than querying one column (PULocationID), leading to a higher estimated number of bytes processed**

4. How many records have a fare_amount of 0?

```sql
-- Count records where fare_amount = 0?
SELECT COUNT(1)
FROM `brukeg_hw3.m_yellow_tripdata_2024`
WHERE fare_amount = 0;
```

| count |
|-------|
| 8333  |


**8,333**

5. What is the best strategy to make an optimized table in Big Query if your query will always filter based on tpep_dropoff_datetime and order the results by VendorID (Create a new table with this strategy)
**Partition by tpep_dropoff_datetime and Cluster on VendorID**

```sql
-- Creating a partition and cluster table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `compact-arc-447521-f9.brukeg_hw3.yellow_tripdata_partitoned_clustered`
PARTITION BY DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime)
CLUSTER BY VendorID AS (
SELECT * 
FROM `compact-arc-447521-f9.brukeg_hw3.external_yellow_tripdata`
);
```

6. Write a query to retrieve the distinct VendorIDs between tpep_dropoff_datetime 2024-03-01 and 2024-03-15 (inclusive). Use the materialized table you created earlier in your from clause and note the estimated bytes. Now change the table in the from clause to the partitioned table you created for question 5 and note the estimated bytes processed. What are these values? Choose the answer which most closely matches.

```sql
-- NON-P/C: retrieve the distinct VendorIDs between tpep_dropoff_datetime 2024-03-01 and 2024-03-15 (inclusive)
SELECT DISTINCT(VendorID)
FROM `brukeg_hw3.m_yellow_tripdata_2024`
WHERE tpep_dropoff_datetime BETWEEN '2024-03-01' AND '2024-03-15'
```

```sql
-- P/C: retrieve the distinct VendorIDs between tpep_dropoff_datetime 2024-03-01 and 2024-03-15 (inclusive)
SELECT DISTINCT(VendorID)
FROM `brukeg_hw3.yellow_tripdata_partitoned_clustered`
WHERE tpep_dropoff_datetime BETWEEN '2024-03-01' AND '2024-03-15'
```

**310.24 MB for non-partitioned table and 26.84 MB for the partitioned table**

7. Where is the data stored in the External Table you created?
**GCP Bucket**

By definition, the external table data is stored where it was uploaded, in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
  

8. It is best practice in Big Query to always cluster your data:
**True**


9. No Points: Write a SELECT count(*) query FROM the materialized table you created. How many bytes does it estimate will be read? Why?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM `brukeg_hw3.m_yellow_tripdata_2024`;
```

**0 bytes, because the row count is stored in meta data so this query doesn't need to run on the table.**

From the BigQuery console you can click on the table name, then navigate to Details, and Storage info you should see row count, 20,332,093.
