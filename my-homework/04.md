1. Understanding dbt model resolution

The environment variables are not invoked in the .sql so the defaults are used instead. It should follow this with the defaults: `select * from [DATABASE].[SCHEMA].[TABLE]`
    
**select * from dtc_zoomcamp_2025.raw_nyc_tripdata.ext_green_taxi**

2. dbt Variables & Dynamic Models

 - We'll make use of `--vars` and a variable `"days_back"` on the command line to take precedent over everything: `--vars '{days_back: NUM}'`
 - When `--vars` is not used from the command line AND an environment variable (`DAYS_BACK`) is set in dev or prod we'll use that.
 - And if `--vars` AND an environemnt variable are NOT set we'll have a default value of 30 to fall back on.
    
    **Update the WHERE clause to pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '{{ var("days_back", env_var("DAYS_BACK", "30")) }}' DAY**

3. dbt Data Lineage and Execution
 - `dbt run` will run the whole project including `fct_taxi_monthly_zone_revenue`.
 - `dbt run --select +models/core/dim_taxi_trips.sql+ --target prod` will run all of `dim_taxi_trips` dependencies and all models that depend on `dim_taxi_trips` of which `fct_taxi_monthly_zone_revenue` is one.
 - `dbt run --select +models/core/fct_taxi_monthly_zone_revenue.sql` this will run `fct_taxi_monthly_zone_revenue` and it's dependencies
 - `dbt run --select +models/core/` this will run everything in `/core` and `fct_taxi_monthly_zone_revenue` is in that directory.
 - `dbt run --select models/staging/+` this will run everything in `/staging` and all models that depend on the models in staging.
    
    **dbt run --select models/staging/+**

4. dbt Macros and Jinja
    1. True
    2. False, defaults to `target_env_var` (which must be set).
    3. True
    4. True
    5. True
    
    **1,3,4,5**

5. Taxi Quarterly Revenue Growth: which were the yearly quarters with the best (or less worse) and worst results for green, and yellow
```sql
WITH best_worst_quarters AS (
    SELECT 
        service_type,
        year_quarter,
        yoy_growth,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY service_type ORDER BY yoy_growth DESC) AS best_rank,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY service_type ORDER BY yoy_growth ASC) AS worst_rank
    FROM `compact-arc-447521-f9.dbt_bgetachew.fact_trips_quarterly_revenue`
    WHERE year = 2020
),
best AS (
SELECT 
    service_type,
    year_quarter AS best_quarter,
    yoy_growth AS best_growth
FROM best_worst_quarters
WHERE best_rank = 1
),
worst AS (
SELECT 
    service_type,
    year_quarter AS worst_quarter,
    yoy_growth AS worst_growth
FROM best_worst_quarters
WHERE worst_rank = 1
)
SELECT *
FROM best JOIN worst USING (service_type);
```

**green: {best: 2020/Q1, worst: 2020/Q2}, yellow: {best: 2020/Q1, worst: 2020/Q2}**

6. P97/P95/P90 Taxi Monthly Fare: what are the values of p97, p95, p90 for Green Taxi and Yellow Taxi, in April 2020?

```sql
SELECT service_type, fare_p97, fare_p95, fare_p90
FROM `compact-arc-447521-f9.dbt_bgetachew.fact_trips_monthly_fare_p95`
WHERE year = 2020
  AND month = 4 
```

I lost access to free dbt cloud before resolving the `0.5` bug, but this is the closest answer so I'm going with it.

**green: {p97: 55.0, p95: 45.0, p90: 26.5}, yellow: {p97: 31.5, p95: 25.5, p90: 19.0}**

7. Top #Nth longest P90 travel time Location for FHV

I ran out of free dbt so I did this in the BigQuery console.
